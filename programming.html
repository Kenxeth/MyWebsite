    <!-- decided to talk about all star code here and how they have helped me  -->
    <div class="programming">
        <p> My whole life I've always been interested in computers especially video games. <br>
            One day, I joined this program called All Star Code and decided to test programming, although <br>
            I was hesitant at first, I started taking a like to coding really fast. I liked the fact that <br>
            problems weren't just formulas but instead logical thinking which made it challenging. Moreover, <br>
            I saw how I enjoyed programming on my free time instead of just playing video games and actually doing <br>
            something that was productive and something that I would honestly like doing as my future job, a Software Developer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            As of right now, I am learning Java in my free time and trying to improve the fundamentals of coding. After learning <br>
            Java, I plan on doing projects so I can make Java my prominent language.
