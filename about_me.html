<!-- PARAGRAPH  -->
     <p id="familyparagraph">  <B>When I think of the most important thing to me it would have to be family. My mom is<br>
        one of the strongest people on this planet which has influenced me to become strong myself <br>
        and has built me a character full of love. My father has taught me to work hard towards my goal as he says, <br>
        "it is very rich to be ignorant". My uncle has taught me always to retain humor because through the toughest <br> 
        times, humor, laughter and family can turn those times upside down. My sister has taught me to <br>
        always to care for people and never forget those who have always been there by your side. My dog <br>
        has taught me that no matter how hard times are, always keep your loved ones on your sight. <br>
        Everyone in my family has a role and I love and Cherish them all very dearly.
